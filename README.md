## Face Recognition with PCA & Machine Learning 
Hi Again, This is Santhosh, your friendly neighbourhood coder. Alright, let’s do this one last time - this is Face Recognition.Welcome to this exciting face recognition project! Here, we blend math, machine learning, and a bit of magic to identify faces with the power of Principal Component Analysis (PCA). By reducing image dimensions while keeping the most important features, our system recognizes faces accurately and efficiently!

### 🚀 Project Overview
Ever wondered how facial recognition works? This project explores just that! We take a dataset of 40 unique individuals, apply PCA to simplify the image data, and then use machine learning to classify faces. Plus, you can even add your own custom images to test it out!

### 🖼️ The Dataset
Contains 40 people, each with 10 images (8 for testing, 2 for training).
You can add your own images to personalize the dataset!
Project Structure
Our project is neatly organized into four main components:

📂 dataset.py – Extracts images & organizes them into training/testing sets.

🖼️ image_to_matrix.py – Converts images into matrices and flattens them for easier processing.

📉 PCA.py – Performs dimensionality reduction using PCA, preserving the most essential features.

🤖 face_recognition.ipynb – Brings everything together! This notebook executes face recognition using all the processed data.

### How to Run the Project
1️⃣ Prepare the Dataset

Place your images in the designated directory.
Ensure the images are properly split into training & testing sets.
2️⃣ Run the Jupyter Notebook

Open face_recognition.ipynb.
Execute the cells step by step.
3️⃣ Observe the Magic!

Watch PCA reduce the dimensions while keeping facial features intact.
See how the model recognizes faces with high accuracy!
### 🎯 Results
Our project showcases how PCA makes facial recognition more efficient by removing unnecessary data while preserving critical features. The chosen machine learning approach ensures accurate classification, making face recognition both fast and effective!

📌 Plus, we’ve prepared a PowerPoint presentation (project_presentation.pptx) and a detailed report (project_report.pdf) to explain our methodology, implementation, and findings.
